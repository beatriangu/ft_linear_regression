An introduction to AI and Machine Learning. Write own gradient descent algorithm to train a linear-regression model that will be used to predict the price of a car.


The first program will be used to predict the price of a car based on its mileage. When you launch the program, it will ask you for mileage and should give you an approximate price of the car.
The second program will be used to train your model. It will read the data set and make a linear regression on this data.

Sorry to hear that. I'll have to try to adjust my algorithm a little more.
