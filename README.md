<p>
    An introduction to AI and Machine Learning. Write your own gradient descent algorithm to train a linear regression model that will be used to predict the price of a car.
</p>

<p>
    The first program will be used to predict the price of a car based on its mileage. When you launch the program, it will ask you for the mileage and should give you an approximate price of the car. 
</p>

<!-- Screenshots for predictions after entering the mileage -->

<code>
(django_venv) c4r4s6% python predict.py
Please enter Kilometrage: 60000
Estimated price for 60000 kms: 7184 €
Is it what you expected? (yes/no): yes
Great! I'll buy it!
(django_venv) c4r4s6% python predict.py

Please enter Kilometrage: 50000
Estimated price for 50000 kms: 7393 €
Is it what you expected? (yes/no): no
Sorry to hear that. I'll have to try to adjust my algorithm a little more.

    The second program will be used to train your model. It will read the data set and perform a linear regression on this data.
